# chat-app
Chat app made with meteor-react

Able to create user acccounts, add and remove contacts/friends, able to chat real-time.
I used meteor because I want to learn meteor. Making this project improved my knowledge of how it works.

To run the app. Type in the command line, cd "path to chat-app" then "meteor" then go to whichever port is given in the command line.
The first thing you need to do when you run the app is to create an account to be able to login. 
After creating an account, you must make a new one on a different browser or incognito to be able to test out the features.
After creating the second account, you can search the name on the search bar. Located on the left side of the main page.
You can then press the account name and add it to your friends. The "add to friend" button is located at the message header on the right side when you click the name.
You can then accept the friend request sent to the second account. After that, you can now start chatting. 

When you start to chat. A sign for a new message will show a blue dot beside the name you are chatting with.
You can also remove a friend using a button that is also located on the same location as the "add a friend button.
